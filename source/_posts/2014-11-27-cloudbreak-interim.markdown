Apparently this is the week of new releases - after the Hadoop 2.5.0 and our Docker container has been [released](http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/11/24/hadoop-252-docker/) we have silently pushed to our hosted [Cloudbreak](http://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/) a new version.

This was due for a while - as during the last few months we have been actively working with customers on new features and now these are made available for all subscribers.

This release is a major cornerstone for us towards GA - planned for mid January - and bringing in architectural changes which opens up the platform towards custom plugins. Just to remember currently
