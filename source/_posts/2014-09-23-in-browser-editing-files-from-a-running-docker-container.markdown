I wish I get 1 dollar each time I install vi in a docker container ... I wanted
an easier way to edit files in a running docker container. First of all try to
avoid editing files at all, as it is against the container philosophy
(see the last paragraph).

But if you have a valid reason, here comes the how-to.

## Why Zedapp

Most of the time I use either vi or [Atom](https://atom.io/), but a few months
ago I stumbled upon [Zedapp](zedapp.org) an opinionated editor. It aims to
reduce cognitive load while editing, by simplifying things, like deliberately
not using tabs.

It stands out with its **first-class support of remote editing** let it be a
remote server, or even directly editing github repositories.

Zedapp just reached version 1.0 and if you like it, consider help Zef Hemmel
at [gratipay](https://gratipay.com/zefhemel/), who was brave enough to quit his
regular job, and work full time on an open-source project!

## Install Zedapp

You can use zedapp as a *chrome plugin* or a *standalone* app. Downloads are
available at: [zedapp.org](http://zedapp.org/download/). I recommend to
go for the **standalone** version.

## Install zedrem

For [remote editing](http://zedapp.org/features/edit-remote-files/),
you need zedrem, a small process serving files to be edited in Zedapp.
Zedrem is packaged into a docker image:
[sequenceiq/zedapp](https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-zedapp)

To start a local zed-server, and zed-client in the target container, there
is a helper script: **zed**

To install the docker image and the shell script run this:
```
docker run --rm \
  -v /usr/local/bin:/target \
  -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/local/bin/docker \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  sequenceiq/zedapp
```

Actually there is only a single binary called **zedrem**, i just use the
[terminology](http://coub.com/view/3ffi8): zed-server and zed-client to
distinguish when you use it with or without the `--server` option.

Now you are ready to start a zedrem session, to edit files in Zedapp which are
inside of a Docker container's directory.

## Start a zedrem session

To start a zedrem client in a container
```
zed <container> <directory>
```

This will:
- start a `zedrem-server` if not already running.
- copy and start `zedrem-client` into the selected container and print out
  the zedrem session's **remote-url**.

Navigate to the project list window by: `Command-Shift-O`/`Ctrl-Shift-O`. Select
 `Remote Folder`, enter the remote-url into `Zedrem URL` input field and press
 `Open`.

Thats all enyoj! All the following paragraphs are for the curious only.

## Boot2docker helper function

The `Install zedrem` step should have detected that you are using Boot2docker,
and instructed you to create a helper function, but in case you missed it, or
for reference:

```
zed() { boot2docker ssh "sudo zed $@" ; }
```
This is needed as the helper script called `zed` is installed inside of
Boot2docker, so you need the ususal `boot2docker ssh` workaround.

after that you can issue directly on OSX:
```
zed <container> <directory>
```

## Local zedrem server.

By default when you want to use Zedapp for remote editing, you need two
other components then Zedapp:

- **zedrem-server** Zedapp gets file content, and sends edit commands
on webservices protocol. It maintains sessions with zedrem-clients.
- **zedrem-client** a small process serving files from a specified directory.

When you use zedrem-client via the official server, all the editing commands/content
travel around the blobe:

![zedrem remote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/docker-zedapp/master/images/zed-remote.png)

Compare it with the dockerized local server setup, which is more quick and
secure:
![zedrem docker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/docker-zedapp/master/images/zed-docker.png)

## nsenter

You might wonder about the step: **copy zedrem into the container**. How is it
possible? Docker's `cp` command only supportts the other direction: copy from a
container into a local dir.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5846), so it
will be fixed soon, but meanwhile you can use nsenter to the rescue. Jérôme
Petazzoni prepared us a canned [nsenter](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter)
with the helper script: `docker-enter`. We can missuse docker-enter to copy
a file from local fs into the container by:

```
cat local-file | docker-enter $container sh -c 'cat>/zedrem'
```

btw: `docker exec` is already merged into the master branch, so it will replace
nsenter completely.

## Don't do this at all

Let's make it clear, that most of the time you don't need this.
First of all editing files in a container, other than development or debug
considered bad practice.

You find yourself editing nginx config files? Don't do it, use the great generic
[nginx appliance](https://github.com/progrium/nginx-appliance) from Jeff Lindsay.

If you **really** need to edit files in a docker container, just use volumes.

This process comes handy if you've already started a container, and the file in
question doesn't sits on a volume.
