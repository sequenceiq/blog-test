    <updated>2014-09-18T07:42:58+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/09/18/custom-image-on-gcc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago we have released <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; the cloud agnostic, open source and Docker based Hadoop as a Service API (with support for <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/27/announcing-periscope/">autoscaling</a> Hadoop clusters). As we have <code>dockerized</code> the whole Hadoop ecosystem, we are shipping the containers to different cloud providers, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Compute. Also Cloudbreak has an <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#add-new-cloud-providers">SDK</a> which allows you to quickly add your favorite cloud provider. In this post (series) we’d like to guide you trough the process, and show you how to create a custom image &ndash; on Google Cloud. We have chose Google Cloud as this is the least documented and has the smallest amount on default images (there are thousand for Amazon, and hundreds for Azure). Nevertheless on all cloud provider usually you’d like to have a custom image with your preferred OS, configuration and potentially installed applications.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Why do we need custom images on every cloud?</h3>

<p>All the above are true for us as well &ndash; with some simplifications. We use Docker to run every process/application &ndash; for the benefits we have covered in other posts many times &ndash; and apart from Docker, our (or the customer’s) preferred OS and a few other helper/debugger things (such as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jpetazzo/nsenter/">nsenter</a>)
we are almost fine. We have made some PAM related fixes/contributions for Docker &ndash; and until they are not in the upstream we have built/derive from our base layer/containers &ndash; so with this and the actual containers included this is pretty much how a cloud base image looks like for us.</p>

<p>As usual we always automate everything &ndash; building custom cloud base images is part of the automation and our CI/CD process as well. For that we use <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> as the preferred IT automation tool. So the first step is to define your own <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html">playbook</a> to install everything on the virtual machine.</p>

<p>A simple playbook looks like this:</p>

<p>```
  &ndash; name: Install Docker</p>

<pre><code>shell: curl -sL https://get.docker.io/ | sh
when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian' or ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>name: Pull sequenceiq/ambari image
shell: docker pull sequenceiq/ambari:pam-fix</p></li>
<li><p>name: Pull jpetazzo/nsenter image
shell: docker pull jpetazzo/nsenter</p></li>
<li><p>name: Install bridge-utils
apt: name=bridge-utils state=latest
when: ansible_distribution == &lsquo;Debian&rsquo; or ansible_distribution == &lsquo;Ubuntu&rsquo;</p></li>
<li><p>name: install jq
shell: curl -o /usr/bin/jq <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/linux64/jq">http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/linux64/jq</a> &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/bin/jq</p></li>
</ul>


<p>```</p>

<p>Using Google cloud you have 2 choices:</p>

<ol>
<li> Create snapshots starting from a default image</li>
<li> Create a custom image</li>
</ol>


<h3>Image creation using snapshots</h3>

<p>We are using Debian as the host OS on Google Cloud, and have created a virtual machine using the default <a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/operating-systems#backported_debian_7_wheezy">Debian</a> image. First thing first, you need to create a persistent disk:</p>

<p><code>
gcloud compute disks create temporary-disk --zone ZONE
</code></p>

<p>Then create a virtual machine with the temporary-disk:</p>

<p><code>
gcloud compute instances create example-instance \
  --scopes storage-rw --image IMAGE \
  --disk name=temporary-disk device-name=temporary-disk --zone ZONE
</code></p>

<p>And attach the disk to the google cloud instance:</p>

<p><code>
gcloud compute instances attach-disk example-instance
  --disk temporary-disk --device-name temporary-disk --zone ZONE
</code></p>

<p>When this is finished then you can <code>shh</code> to the <code>sample-instance</code>. You can now check your mounted volumes with this command:</p>

<p><code>
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/google-*
</code></p>

<p>Now you need to create a folder which will contain your custom built image:</p>

<p><code>
sudo mkdir /mnt/tmp
</code></p>

<p>You have to format your partition before the image creation:</p>

<p><code>
sudo /usr/share/google/safe_format_and_mount -m "mkfs.ext4 -F" /dev/sdb /mnt/tmp
</code></p>

<p>Now you can start building the image which will last about 10 minutes:</p>

<p><code>
sudo gcimagebundle -d /dev/sda -o /mnt/tmp/ --log_file=/tmp/imagecreation.log
</code></p>

<p>You have now an image in /tmp with a special hex number like <code>/tmp/HEX-NUMBER.image.tar.gz</code></p>

<p>Once you uploaded it to a Google bucket you are done, and ready to use it.</p>

<p><code>
gsutil cp /mnt/tmp/IMAGE_NAME.image.tar.gz gs://BUCKET_NAME
</code></p>

<h3>Create a custom image &ndash; using your favorite OS</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu server 14.04</a> is many’s preferred Linux distribution &ndash; unluckily there is no default image using Ubuntu as the OS in the Google Cloud](<a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/operating-systems">https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/operating-systems</a>). Luckily this is not that complicated &ndash; the process below works with any other OS as well. In order to start you should have <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> installed. Download an Ubuntu server from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu’s</a> web page.
Install in into the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> box, start it and <code>ssh</code> into. Once you are inside you will have to install the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/sdk/">Google Cloud SDK</a>. This is needed for the custom image, as contains some extra feature like <code>google-startup-scripts</code>. Remember that Ubuntu (and in general a few cloud providers) support <code>cloud-init</code> scripts, and this is why we need the Google Cloud SDK &ndash; as we ship these images to the <code>cloud</code>.</p>

<p>After the installation add the following kernel options into the <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>to enable paravirtualization</h1>

<p>CONFIG_KVM_GUEST=y</p>

<h1>to enable the paravirtualized clock.</h1>

<p>CONFIG_KVM_CLOCK=y</p>

<h1>to enable paravirtualized PCI devices.</h1>

<p>CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI=y</p>

<h1>to enable access to paravirtualized disks.</h1>

<p>CONFIG_SCSI_VIRTIO=y</p>

<h1>to enable access to the networking.</h1>

<p>CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y
```</p>

<p>Now you are ready to prepare an <code>official</code> image into a tar file, by selecting the virtual box image file on your disk and convert it.
You can convert your <code>vmdk</code> file into the supported raw type by using:</p>

<p><code>
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw VMDK_FILE_NAME.vmdk disk.img
</code></p>

<p>The .img file name has to be <code>disk.img</code>. After you have converted the image, you have to make a tar file:</p>

<p><code>
tar -Szcf &lt;image-tar-name&gt;.tar.gz disk.raw
</code></p>

<p>Same as before, you have to upload in to a Google Cloud Bucket:</p>

<p><code>
gsutil cp &lt;image-tar-name&gt;.tar.gz gs://&lt;bucket-name&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Now you have an <code>official</code> image template but you have to create the image in Google Cloud:</p>

<p><code>
gcutil addimage my-ubuntu gs://&lt;bucket-name&gt;/ubuntu_image.tar.gz
</code></p>

<p>Once this is done you have created your custom built Google Cloud image, and you are ready to start cloud instances using it. Let us know how it works for you, and make sure you follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sequenceiq/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sequenceiq">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sequenceiq">Facebook</a> for updates.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/29/aws-cloudformation-makes-everything-easier/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-29T14:13:06+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/29/aws-cloudformation-makes-everything-easier</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our Hadoop as a Service solution, <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com">Cloudbreak</a> integrates with multiple cloud providers to deploy Hadoop clusters in the cloud. It means that every time a cluster is requested, Cloudbreak goes to the selected cloud provider and creates a new, separated infrastructure through the provider’s API. Building this infrastructure can be a real pain and can cause a lot of problems &ndash; it involves a lot of API calls, the polling of created building blocks, the management of failures and the necessary rollbacks to name a few. With the help of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> we were able to avoid most of these problems when integrating AWS in Cloudbreak.</p>

<h3>Problems with the traditional approach</h3>

<p>When Cloudbreak creates a Hadoop cluster it should first create the underlying infrastructure on the cloud provider. The building blocks are a bit different on every provider, the following resources are created on AWS:</p>

<ul>
<li>a virtual private cloud (VPC)</li>
<li>a subnet</li>
<li>an internet gateway</li>
<li>a route table</li>
<li>an auto scaling group and its launch configuration</li>
<li>a security group</li>
</ul>


<p>Although AWS has a pretty good API and great SDKs to communicate with it, we needed to deal with the above described problems if we would like to create all of these elements one by one through the Java SDK. The code would start with something like this with the creation of the VPC:</p>

<p>```java
AmazonEC2Client amazonEC2Client = new AmazonEC2Client(basicSessionCredentials);
amazonEC2Client.setRegion(region);</p>

<p>CreateVpcRequest vpcRequest = new CreateVpcRequest().withCidrBlock(10.0.0.0/24);
CreateVpcResponse vpcResponse = amazonEC2Client.createVpc(createVpcRequest);</p>

<p>//poll vpc creation until it’s state is available
waitForVPC(amazonEC2Client, vpcResponse.getVpc());</p>

<p>ModifyVpcAttributeRequest modifyVpcRequest = new ModifyVpcAttributeRequest().withEnableDnsHostnames(true).withEnableDnsSupport(true);
amazonEC2Cient.modifyVpcAttribute(modifyVpcRequest);
```</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The above code is only a taste of the whole thing. The VPC is one of the most simple resources with very few attributes to set. Also the polling of the creation process isn’t detailed here as well as failure handling. In addition the different resources would be scattered around the code making it impossible to have an overview of the whole stack and making it much harder to find bugs or to modify some attributes. With CloudFormation all of the above problems can be solved very easily.</p>

<h3>Introduction to CloudFormation</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation documentation</a> it was designed to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources easily and provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. What it really means is that the resources can be described declaratively in a JSON document (a <em>template</em>) and the whole <em>stack</em> can be created/updated/deleted with a simple API call. AWS also handles failures, and rollbacks the whole stack if something goes wrong. Furthermore it is able to send notifications to <em>SNS topics</em> when some event occurs (e.g.: a resource creation started or the resource is completed), making the polling of resource creations unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Template structure</h3>

<p>We don’t want to give a detailed introduction on how the structure of a CloudFormation template look like, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html">AWS documentation</a> covers it really well and there are also a lot of <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html">samples</a>.
Instead we’re trying to focus on the advantages that CloudFormation gave us while using it, so let’s jump in the middle and start with a simple example. The declaration of a VPC in a template looks like this:</p>

<p>```json
&ldquo;Resources&rdquo; : {
  &ldquo;MY_VPC&rdquo; : {</p>

<pre><code>"Type" : "AWS::EC2::VPC",
"Properties" : {
  "CidrBlock" : { "10.0.0.0/16" },
  "EnableDnsSupport" : "true",
  "EnableDnsHostnames" : "true",
  "Tags" : [
    { "Key" : "Application", "Value" : { "Ref" : "AWS::StackId" } },
    { "Key" : "Network", "Value" : "Public" }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The JSON syntax can be a bit complicated sometimes, especially when dealing with a lot of references to other properties with the <em>&ldquo;Ref&rdquo;</em> keyword or some other built-in CloudFormation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference.html">functions</a>, but it is much clearer than the Java code above.
Other than resources, there are other parts of a CloudFormation template (<em>Conditions</em>, <em>Mappings</em>, <em>Outputs</em>, <em>Intrinsic Functions</em>) but here we will cover only one more: <em>Parameters</em>.</p>

<p>Declaring a parameter means that there is no hard-coded value for a given attribute, rather it is given to the template when creating the stack. If you’d like to have an EC2 Instance  in your template but you don’t want to hardcode its type, you can have a parameter like this:</p>

<p>```json
&ldquo;Parameters&rdquo; : {
  &ldquo;InstanceType&rdquo; : {</p>

<pre><code>"Description" : "EC2 instance type",
"Type" : "String",
"Default" : "m3.medium",
"AllowedValues" : [ "m3.medium","m3.large","m3.xlarge","m3.2xlarge"],
"ConstraintDescription" : "must be a valid EC2 instance type."
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>After it’s declared, you can reference it from a resource with the <em>Ref</em> keyword:</p>

<p>```json
&ldquo;EC2Instance&rdquo; : {
  &ldquo;Type&rdquo; : &ldquo;AWS::EC2::Instance&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; : {</p>

<pre><code>"SecurityGroups" : [ { "Ref" : "InstanceSecurityGroup" } ],
"InstanceType" : { "Ref" : "InstanceType" },
"KeyName" : { "Ref" : "KeyName" },
"ImageId" : "ami-123456",
"EbsOptimized" : "true"
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>You can reference not only parameters, but other resources as well. In the above code example there is a reference to <em>InstanceSecurityGroup</em> that is an <em>AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup</em> type resource and that is declared in an other part of the template.</p>

<h3>Creating the stack</h3>

<p>So we’ve declared a few resources, how can we tell AWS to create the stack? Let’s see how it looks like with the Java SDK (two parameters are passed to the template):</p>

<p>```java
CreateStackRequest createStackRequest = new CreateStackRequest()</p>

<pre><code>.withStackName(“MyCFStack")
.withTemplateBody(templateAsString)
.withNotificationARNs(notificationTopicARN)
.withParameters(
    new Parameter().withParameterKey("InstanceCount").withParameterValue(“3"),
    new Parameter().withParameterKey("InstanceType").withParameterValue(“m3.large"));
</code></pre>

<p>client.createStack(createStackRequest);
```</p>

<p>And that’s it. It’s every code that should written in Java to create the complete stack. It is pretty straightforward, the only thing that needs to be explained is the <em>notification ARN</em> part. It is the identifier of an <em>SNS topic</em> and it is detailed below.</p>

<h3>Callbacks</h3>

<p>CloudFormation is able to send notifications to SNS <em>topics</em> when an event occurs. An event is when a resource creation is started, finished or failed (and the same with delete). SNS is Amazon’s Simple Notification Service that enables endpoints to subscribe to a topic, and when a message is sent to a topic every subscriber receives that message. AWS supports a lot of endpoint types. It can send notifications by email or text message, to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint. In the Cloudbreak project we’re using HTTP endpoints as callback URLs. We’re also creating topics and subscriptions from code but that could fill up another full blog post.</p>

<p>If you just like to try SNS, you can create a topic and a subscription from the AWS Console. After you have a confirmed subscription of an HTTP endpoint (e.g.: <em>example.com/sns</em>), you can very easily create an HTTP endpoint in Java (with some help from <a href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a>):</p>

<p><code>java
@RequestMapping(value="sns", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseBody
public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; receiveSnsMessage(@RequestBody String request) {
  // parse and handle request
}
</code></p>

<p>For a more detailed example see the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/controller/AmazonSnsController.java">controller class</a> in Cloudbreak.
So every time a CloudFormation stack event occurs, Cloudbreak receives a message that is parsed and handled correctly &ndash; there is no need to poll the creation of resources and dealing with timeouts.</p>

<h3>Failures and rollbacks</h3>

<p>It is always possible that something will go wrong when creating a stack with a lot of resources. With the traditional approach you must keep track of the resources that were created and you will have to implement some rollback logic that gets called when something unexpected happens and that rolls back the already created elements somehow. With CloudFormation these things are completely done by AWS.</p>

<p>The resources in the stack are tracked so the only thing you have to save is the identifier of the stack. If one of the resources fails to be created AWS rolls back every other resource and puts the stack in <em>ROLLBACK_COMPLETED</em> state. It also sends the failure message to the SNS topic with the exact cause of the failure.
The same is true if you’d like to delete the stack. The only call that you will have to send to the AWS API is the deletion of the stack (very similar to the creation in Java). CloudFormation will delete every resource one by one and will take care of failures.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The template we used in Cloudbreak is available <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/blob/master/src/main/resources/templates/aws-cf-stack.ftl">here</a>. It is not a pure CloudFormation template because of some limitations &ndash; the number of attached volumes cannot be specified dynamically and it is not possible to specify it as a parameter if spot priced instances are needed or not &ndash; we ended up generating the template with Freemarker.</p>

<h3>Terraform</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hashicorp.com/products">company</a> that brought us <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, <a href="http://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> and a few more useful things has recently announced a new project named <a href="http://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">Terraform</a>. Terraform is inspired by tools like CloudFormation or <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat">OpenStack’s Heat</a>, but goes further as it supports multiple cloud platforms and their services can also be combined. If you’re interested in managing infrastructure from code and configuration you should check out that project too, we’ll keep an eye on it for sure.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fair play]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/16/fairplay/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-16T14:45:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/16/fairplay</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently we’ve been asked an interesting question &ndash; how fair is the YARN <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html">FairScheduler</a> &ndash; while we never use internally the fair scheduler after a quick test the short answer is &ndash; <strong>very fair</strong>.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/">SequenceIQ</a> we always use the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html">CapacityScheduler</a> &ndash; actually an enhanced version of it (coming with the 2.6.0 release of Hadoop). Since the emergence of YARN and the new schedulers we were working on a solution to bring SLA to Hadoop &ndash; and part of this work was our contribution to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1495">Apache YARN schedulers</a> and <a href="http://ambari.apache.org/">Apache Ambari</a>. Anyway, we decided to configure a FairScheduler in one of our 20 node test cluster and run a quick test.</p>

<h3>Fair scheduler</h3>

<p>Remember than before YARN only one resource represented a resource on a cluster &ndash; the <code>slot</code>. Every node had slots, and your MR job was taking up slots , regardless of their actual resource usage (CPU, memory). It worked but for sure it wasn’t a fair game &ndash; and caused lots of frustration between administrators of applications competing for <code>slots</code>. We have seen many over and undersubscribed nodes in terms of CPU and memory. YARN introduced the concept of containers and the ability to request/attach resources to them (vCores and memory).</p>

<p>While this seams already a big step forward comparing with slots, it brought up other problems &ndash; with multiple resources as <code>vCores</code> and <code>memory</code> and <code>disk</code> and <code>network i/o</code> in the future it’s pretty challenging to share them fairly. With a single resource it would we pretty straightforward &ndash; nevertheless the community based on a <a href="http://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/full_papers/Ghodsi.pdf">research paper</a> coming out from UC Berkeley (Ghodsi et al) managed to get this working through (again a community effort) this <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-326">YARN ticket</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s battle test how fair is the scheduler when running two MR application with changing resource usage &ndash; how well the dominant resource fairness works.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The test</h3>

<p>We decided to take a pretty easy MR job with 64 input files. In order to bring in some  variables, the input files are a multiple of 4MB, distributed as the smallest is 4MB and the largest is 256MB. The used <code>block size</code> is 256MB, and the number of nodes in the cluster is <strong>20</strong>. We are using and open sourced an <strong>R based</strong> <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring">YARN monitoring</a> project &ndash; feel free to use it and let us know if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>We were running two jobs &ndash; and the task&rsquo;s input was descending e.g. <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000001</em> has a 252MB input file and <em>task_1398345200850_0079_m_000063</em> has a 4MB input. Obliviously the tasks were not necessarily executed in this order, because the order depends on when the nodemanager asks for task.</p>

<p>See the <code>timeboxed</code> result of the two runs.</p>

<p><strong>Run 61</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run61.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Run 62</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/run62.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While the <code>timeboxed</code> version will not really help to decide the resource usage and the elapsed time (which should be pretty much equal) it’s good to show the time spent on different nodes. Many times generating these charts helped us to identify hardware or other software/configuration issues on different nodes (for example when a run execution is outside of the standard deviation). You can use our R project and file to generate charts as such with the help of <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/yarn-monitoring/blob/master/RProjects/TimeBoxes.R">TimeBoxes.R</a> file.</p>

<p>Now if we compare the two execution files and place it on the same chart we will actually see that the FairScheduler is <strong>fairly Fair</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/yarn-monitoring-R/images/test8_active_mapppers_num.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Random ideas</h3>

<p>While the purpose of these tests was to show that the fair scheduler distributes resources in a fair way &ndash; sorry I can’t help &ndash; we can see that the executions of the map tasks are not optimal, but at least stable. Also we can notice that the execution order depends also on the blocks locations; if you should know/consider the blocks location ahead the execution could be more optimal.</p>

<p>Measured a few other things as well &ndash; will discuss this on a different post &ndash; and from those charts you can see that the elapsed time of a task grow even as there are free slots.  Also as the number of mappers come closer to the available free slots of the cluster the average elapsed times of the tasks grow &ndash; due to different reasons (which we will share on a forthcoming post).</p>

<p>Since we are not really using the <strong>FairScheduler</strong> and we had one now configured we decided to run a few of our performance tests as well, and while submitting jobs like <code>crazy</code> using the fair scheduler we managed to <code>logjam</code> the cluster.
We have never seen this before while using the <strong>CapacityScheduler</strong> &ndash; and digging into details we figured that the FairScheduler is missing the <code>yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent</code> property. This <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1913">issue</a> appears to be a bug in the FairScheduler &ndash; fixed in the 2.5 release.</p>

<p>While we don’t want to make any comparison between the two schedulers I think that the FairScheduler is a very viable and good option for those having a cluster and doesn’t want to bother with <strong>capacity planning ahead</strong>. Also I was impressed by the fine grain rules which you can use with the FairScheduler while deciding on the resource allocations.</p>

<p>Note that we are working and open sourcing a project which brings SLA to Hadoop and allows auto-scaling using <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; our open source, cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API. The project is called <strong>Periscope</strong> and will be open sourced very soon.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T08:53:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/12/docker-networking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this blog entry is to cover advanced topics regarding Docker networking and explain different concepts to inter-connect Docker containers when the containers are running on different host machines.
For the demonstration we are using VMs on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> launched with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, but the explained networking concepts work also on Amazon EC2 (with VPC) and Azure unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>To set up the the test environment clone the <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples">SequenceIQ&rsquo;s samples repository</a> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@github.com:sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples.git
cd sequenceiq-samples/docker-networking
vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>The <code>vagrant up</code> command launches the test setup, which conatins two Ubuntu 14.04 VMs with the network configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat">NAT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html">Private networking</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The NAT (related to eth0 interface on VMs) is used only for access the external network from VMs e.g. download files from debian repository, but it is not used for inter-container communication. The Vagrant sets up a properly configured Host Only Networking in VirtualBox therefore the VMs can communicate with each other on the defined IP addresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 192.168.40.11</li>
<li>vm2: 192.168.40.12</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see how Docker containers running on these VMs can send IP packets to each other.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Setting up bridge0</h2>

<p>The Docker attaches all containers to the virtual subnet implemented by docker0, this means that by default on both VMs the Docker containers will be launched with IP addresses from range 172.17.42.1/24. This is a problem for some of the solutions explained below, because if the containers on different hosts have the same IP addresses then we won&rsquo;t be able to properly route the IP packets between them. Therefore on each VMs a network bridge is created with the following subnets:</p>

<ul>
<li>vm1: 172.17.51.1/24</li>
<li>vm2: 172.17.52.1/24</li>
</ul>


<p>This means that every container luanched on vm1 will get an IP address from range 172.17.51.2 &ndash; 172.17.51.255 and containers on vm2 will have an address from range 172.17.52.2 &ndash; 172.17.52.255.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.51.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart</p>

<h1>do not execute, it was already executed on vm1 as root during provision from Vagrant</h1>

<p>sudo brctl addbr bridge0
sudo ifconfig bridge0 172.17.52.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo bash -c &lsquo;echo DOCKER_OPTS=\&ldquo;-b=bridge0\&rdquo; >> /etc/default/docker&rsquo;
sudo service docker restart
```</p>

<p>As noted in the comments the above configuration is already executed during the provisioning of VMs and it was copied here just for the sake of clarity and completeness.</p>

<h2>Expose container ports to host</h2>

<p>Probably the simplest way to solve inter-container communication is to expose ports from container to the host. This can be done with the <code>-p</code> switch. E.g. exposing the port 3333 is as simple as:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 -p 3333:3333 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>This might be well suited for cases when the communication ports are defined in advance (e.g. MySQL will run on port 3306), but will not work when the application uses dynamic ports for communication (like Hadoop does with IPC ports).</p>

<h2>Host networking</h2>

<p>If the container is started with <code>--net=host</code> then it avoids placing the container inside of a separate network stack, but as the Docker documentation says this option &ldquo;tells Docker to not containerize the container&rsquo;s networking&rdquo;. The <code>cont1</code> container can bind directly to the network interface of host therefore the <code>nc</code> will be available directly on 192.168.40.11.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1 &mdash;net=host ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -l 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2 ubuntu /bin/bash -c &ldquo;nc -w 1 -v 192.168.40.11 3333&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 192.168.40.11 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Of course if you want to access cont2 from cont1 then cont2 also needs to be started with <code>--net=host</code> option.
The host networking is very powerful solution for inter-container communication, but it has its drawbacks, since the ports used by the container can collide with the ports used by host or other containers utilising &mdash;net=host option, because all of them are sharing the same network stack.</p>

<h2>Direct Routing</h2>

<p>So far we have seen methods where the containers have used the IP address of host to communicate with each other, but there are solutions to inter-connect the containers by using their own IPs. If we are using the containers own IPs for routing then it is important that we shall be able to distinguish based on IP which container is running on vm1 and which one is running on on vm2, this was the reason why the bridge0 interface was created as explained in &ldquo;Setting up bridge0&rdquo; section.
To make the things a bit easier to understand I have created a simplified diagram of the network interfaces in our current test setup. If I would like to oversimplify the thing then I would say that, we shall setup the routing in that way that the packets from one container are following the red lines shown on the diagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/routing.png</a>"></p>

<p>To achive this we need to configure the routing table on hosts in that way that every packet which destination is 172.17.51.0/24 is forwarded to vm1 and every IP packet where the destination is 172.17.52.0/24 is forwarded to vm2. To repeat it shortly, the containers running on vm1 are placed to subnet 172.17.51.0/24, containers on vm2 are on subnet 172.17.52.0/24.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.40.12
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0  netmask 255.255.255.0  gw 192.168.40.11
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>route add</code> command adds the desired routing to the route table, but you might wonder why the iptables configuration is necessary. The reason for that the Docker by default sets up a rule to the nat table to masquerade all IP packets that are leaving the machine. In our case we definitely don&rsquo;t want this, therefore we delete all MASQUERADE rules with -F option. At this point we already would be able to make the connection from one container to other and vice verse, but the containers would not be able to communicate with the outside world, therefore an iptables rule needs to be added to masquerade the packets that are going outside of 172.17.0.0/16. I need to mention the another approach would be to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/articles/networking/#between-containers">&mdash;iptables=false</a> option of the daemon to avoid any manipulation in the iptables and you can do all the config manually.</p>

<p>Such kind of direct routing from one vm to other vm works great and easy to set up, but cannot be used if the hosts are not on the same subnet. If the host are located the on different subnet the tunneling might be an option as you will see it in the next section.</p>

<p><em>Note: This solution works on Amazon EC2 instances only if the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck">Source/Destionation Check</a> is disabled.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: Due to the packet filtering policy of Azure this method cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel</h2>

<p>GRE is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links.
The main idea is to create a GRE tunnel between the VMs and send all traffic through it:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="<a" src="href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/sequenceiq-samples/master/docker-networking/img/gre.png</a>"></p>

<p>In order to create a tunnel you need to specify the name, the type (which is gre in our case) and the IP address of local and the remote end. Consequently the tun2 name used for the tunnel on on vm1 since from vm1 perspective that is the tunnel endpoint which leads to vm2 and every packet sent to tun2 to will eventually come out on vm2 end.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun2 mode gre local 192.168.40.11 remote 192.168.40.12
sudo ifconfig tun2 10.0.201.1
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>GRE tunnel config execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo iptunnel add tun1 mode gre local 192.168.40.12 remote 192.168.40.11
sudo ifconfig tun1 10.0.202.1
sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>After the tunnel is set up and activated the remaining commands are very similar to the commands executed in the &ldquo;Direct Routing&rdquo; section. The main difference here is that we do not route the traffic directly to other vm, but we are routing it into <code>dev tun1</code> and <code>dev tun2</code> respectively.</p>

<p>With GRE tunnels a point-to-point connection is set up between two hosts, which means that if you have more then two hosts in your network and want to interconnect all of them, then n-1 tunnel endpoint needs to be created on every host, which will be quite challenging to maintain if you have a large cluster.</p>

<p><em>Note: GRE packets are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn133803.aspx">filtered out</a> on Azure therefore this solution cannot be used there.</em></p>

<h2>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h2>

<p>If more secured connections is required between containers then VPNs can be used on VMs. This addiotional security might significantly increase processing overhead. This overhead is highly depends on which VPN solution are you going to use. In this demo we use the VPN capabilities of SSH which is not really suited for production use. In order to enable the VPN capabilites of ssh the  PermitTunnel parameter needs to be switched on in sshd_config. If you are using the Vagranfile provided to this tutorial then nothing needs to be done, since this parameter was already set up for you during provisioning in the bootstrap.sh.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>execute on vm1</h1>

<p>sudo ssh -f -N -w 2:1 <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#114;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#x74;&#x40;&#x31;&#x39;&#x32;&#x2e;&#49;&#x36;&#56;&#46;&#52;&#x30;&#46;&#x31;&#x32;">&#114;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#116;&#64;&#49;&#x39;&#50;&#46;&#49;&#54;&#x38;&#46;&#52;&#48;&#x2e;&#49;&#x32;</a>
sudo ifconfig tun2 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.52.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun2
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.51.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont1  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont1)</h1>

<p>nc -l 3333</p>

<h1>execute on vm2</h1>

<p>sudo ifconfig tun1 up
sudo route add -net 172.17.51.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tun1
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.17.52.0/24 ! -d 172.17.0.0/16 -j MASQUERADE
sudo docker run -it &mdash;rm &mdash;name cont2  ubuntu /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Inside the container (cont2)</h1>

<p>nc -w 1 -v 172.17.51.2 3333</p>

<h1>Result: Connection to 172.17.51.2 3333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The ssh is launched with -w option where the numerical ids of tun devices were specified. After executing the command the tunnel interfaces are created on both VMs. The interfaces needs to be be activated with ifconfig up and after that we need to setup the rooting to direct the traffic to  172.17.51.0/24 and 172.17.52.0/24 to tun2 and tun1.</p>

<p>As mentioned the VPN capabilities of SSH is not recommended in production, but other solutions like  <a href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a> would worth a try to secure the communication between the hosts (and also between the containers).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The above examples were hand written mainly for demonstration purposes, but there are great tools like <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework">Pipework</a> that can make your life simpler and will do the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>If you want to check how these methods are working in production environment you are just a few clicks from it, since under the hood these methods are responsible to solve the inter-container communication in our cloud agnostic Hadoop as a Service API called <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/07/clodubreak-shell/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-07T19:43:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/08/07/clodubreak-shell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few weeks back we have announced <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/07/18/announcing-cloudbreak/">Cloudbreak</a> &ndash; the open source Hadoop as a Service API. Included in the release we open sourced a REST API, REST client, UI and a CLI/shell. In this post we’d like to show you how easy is to use <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell">Cloudbreak shell</a> in order to create on demand Hadoop clusters on your favorite cloud provider.</p>

<p>While it’s up to everybody&rsquo;s personal preference whether to use a UI, a command line interface or the REST API directly, at SequenceIQ we prefer to use command line tools whenever it’s possible because it’s much faster than interacting with a web UI and it’s a better candidate for automation. Yeah &ndash; we have mentioned this many times &ndash; we are <code>obsessed with automation</code>; any step which is a candidate of doing it twice we script and automate it.</p>

<p>This <code>thing</code> with the automation does not affect the effort and quality standards we put on building the UI &ndash; <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> has an extremely intuitive and clean <strong>responsive</strong> UI and it’s built on the latest and greatest web UI framework &ndash; <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a>. We will have a post about the UI, however we consider it so simple to use that we ask you to go ahead and give it a try. You are a signup and a few clicks away from your Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>Now back to the CLI. Remember one of our Apache contribution &ndash; the <a href="http://blog.sequenceiq.com/blog/2014/05/26/ambari-shell/">Ambari shell and REST API</a>? Well, the Cloudbreak shell is built on the same technology &ndash; Spring Shell. It’s an interactive shell that can be easily extended using a Spring based programming model and battle tested in various projects like Spring Roo, Spring XD, and Spring REST Shell Combine these two projects to create a powerful tool.</p>

<h2>Cloudbreak Shell</h2>

<p>The goal with the CLI was to provide an interactive command line tool which supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>all functionality available through the REST API or Cloudbreak web UI</li>
<li>makes possible complete automation of management task via <strong>scripts</strong></li>
<li>context aware command availability</li>
<li>tab completion</li>
<li>required/optional parameter support</li>
<li><strong>hint</strong> command to guide you on the usual path</li>
</ul>


<h2>Install Cloudbreak Shell</h2>

<p>You have 3 options to give it a try:</p>

<ul>
<li>use our prepared <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/">docker image</a></li>
<li>download the latest self-containing executable jar form our maven repo</li>
<li>build it from source</li>
</ul>


<p>We will follow up with the first two, in this post we’d like to guide you through the third option.</p>

<h3>Build from source</h3>

<p>If want to use the code or extend it with new commands follow the steps below. You will need:
&ndash; jdk 1.7
&ndash; maven 3.x.x</p>

<p><code>
git clone https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak-shell.git
cd cloudbreak-shell
mvn clean package
</code></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Connect to Cloudbreak</h2>

<p>In order to use the shell you will have to have a Cloudbreak account. You can get one by subscribing to our hosted and free <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak</a> instance. Alternatively you can build your own Cloudbreak and deploy it within your organization &ndash; for that just follow up with the steps in the Cloudbreak <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#quickstart-and-installation">documentation</a>. We suggest to try our hosted solution as in case you have any issues we can always help you with. Please feel free to create bugs, ask for enhancements or just give us feedback by either using our <a href="https://github.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak">GitHub repository</a> or the other channels highlighted in the product documentation (Google Groups, email or social channels).
The shell is built as a single executable jar with the help of <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>.</p>

<p>```
Usage:
  java -jar cloudbreak-shell-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar                  : Starts Cloudbreak Shell in interactive mode.
  java -jar cloudbreak-shell-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &mdash;cmdfile=<FILE> : Cloudbreak executes commands read from the file.</p>

<p>Options:
  &mdash;cloudbreak.host=<HOSTNAME>       Hostname of the Cloudbreak REST API Server [use:cloudbreak-api.sequenceiq.com].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.port=<PORT>           Port of the Cloudbreak REST API Server [use:80].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.user=<USER>           Username of the Cloudbreak user [use:your user name ].
  &mdash;cloudbreak.password=<PASSWORD>   Password of the Cloudbreak admin [use: your password].</p>

<p>Note:
  All options are mandatory.
<code>``
Once you are connected you can start to create a cluster. If you are lost and need guidance through the process you can use</code>hint<code>. You can always use</code>TAB<code>for completion. Note that all commands are</code>context aware` &ndash; they are available only when it makes sense &ndash; this way you are never confused and guided by the system on the right path.</p>

<h3>Create a cloud credential</h3>

<p>In order to start using Cloudbreak you will need to have a cloud user, for example an Amazon AWS account. Note that Cloudbreak <strong>does not</strong> store you cloud user details &ndash; we work around the concept of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a> &ndash; on Amazon (or other cloud providers) you will have to create an IAM role, a policy and associate that with your Cloudbreak account &ndash; for further documentation please refer to the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#accounts">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code>
credential createEC2 --description “description" --name “myCredentialName" --roleArn "arn:aws:iam::NUMBER:role/cloudbreak-ABC" --sshKeyUrl “URL towards your AWS public key"
</code></p>

<p>Alternatively you can upload your public key from a file as well, by using the <code>—sshKeyPath</code> switch. You can check whether the credential was creates successfully by using the <code>credential list</code> command. You can switch between your cloud credential &ndash; when you’d like to use one and act with that you will have to use:</p>

<p><code>
credential select --id #ID of the credential
</code></p>

<h3>Create a template</h3>

<p>A template gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related resources, maintaining and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).</p>

<p><code>
template createEC2 --description "awstemplate" --name "awstemplate" --region EU_WEST_1 --instanceType M3Large --sshLocation 0.0.0.0/0
</code>
You can check whether the template was created successfully by using the <code>template list</code> command. Check the template with or select if you are happy with:</p>

<p>```
template show &mdash;id #ID of the template</p>

<p>template select &mdash;id #ID of the template
```</p>

<h3>Create a stack</h3>

<p>Stacks are template <code>instances</code> &ndash; a running cloud infrastructure created based on a template. Use the following command to create a stack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:</p>

<p><code>
stack create --name “myStackName" --nodeCount 20
</code></p>

<h3>Select a blueprint</h3>

<p>We ship default Hadoop cluster blueprints with Cloudbreak. You can use these blueprints or add yours. To see the available blueprints and use one of them please use:</p>

<p>```
blueprint list</p>

<p>blueprint select &mdash;id #ID of the blueprint
```</p>

<h3>Create a Hadoop cluster</h3>

<p>You are almost done &ndash; one more command and this will create your Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider. Same as the API, or UI this will use your <code>template</code>, and by using CloudFormation will launch a cloud <code>stack</code> &ndash; once the <code>stack</code> is up and running (cloud provisioning is done) it will use your selected <code>blueprint</code> and install your custom Hadoop cluster with the selected components and services. For the supported list of Hadoop components and services please check the <a href="http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#supported-components">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><code>
cluster create --description “my cluster desc"
</code>
You are done &ndash; you can check the progress through the Ambari UI. If you log back to <a href="https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/">Cloudbreak UI</a> you can check the progress over there as well, and learn the IP address of Ambari.</p>

<h3>Automate the process</h3>

<p>Each time you start the shell the executed commands are logged in a file line by line and later either with the <code>script</code> command or specifying an <code>—cmdfile</code> option the same commands can be executed again.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>For the full list of available commands please check below. Please note that all commands are context aware, and you can always use <code>TAB</code> for command completion.</p>

<pre><code>* blueprint add - Add a new blueprint with either --url or --file
* blueprint defaults - Adds the default blueprints to Cloudbreak
* blueprint list - Shows the currently available blueprints
* blueprint select - Select the blueprint by its id
* blueprint show - Shows the blueprint by its id
* cluster create - Create a new cluster based on a blueprint and template
